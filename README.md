    <h1>Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers</h1>
    <p>
        Our "Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers" is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to enhance road safety by addressing the critical issue of driver drowsiness. Utilizing advanced technology, the system employs infrared (IR) sensors, a motor simulation, a buzzer, and a mobile application to actively monitor and respond to the driver's alertness level.

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Driver Monitoring with IR Sensors:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>IR sensors are strategically placed to continuously monitor the driver's facial features, particularly focusing on eye movements and blinking patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Real-time Data Processing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>An intelligent algorithm processes the data from the IR sensors in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness or fatigue based on predefined parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Motor Simulation and Buzzer Alert:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In the event of detected drowsiness, a motor simulates the vehicle coming to a stop, alerting the driver to their drowsy state.</li>
                <li>A buzzer provides an audible warning, enhancing the effectiveness of the alert system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>IoT Connectivity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The system is seamlessly integrated with an IoT platform, allowing real-time communication between the vehicle and a dedicated mobile application.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mobile Application Control:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A user-friendly mobile application provides continuous updates on the driver's status, vehicle status, and any triggered alerts.</li>
                <li>Remote control features empower users to intervene and stop the vehicle through the mobile app if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
